GPT-5 for Coding

While powerful, prompting with GPT-5 can differ from other models. Here are tips to get the most out of it via the API or in
your coding tools.

#1. Be precise and avoid conflicting information

             #2. Use the right reasoning effort



The new GPT-5 models are significantly better at               GPT-5 will always perform some level of reasoning as it
instruction following, but a side effect is that they can      solves problems. To get the best results, use high reasoning
struggle when asked to follow vague or conflicting             effort for the most complex tasks. If you see the model
instructions, especially in your .cursor/rules or AGENTS.md    overthink simple problems, be more specific or choose a

Together with Cursor, we found GPT-5 works well when
using XML-like syntax to give the model more context. For         Be THOROUGH when gathering information.

#5. Give room for planning and self-reflection

               #6. Control the eagerness of your coding agent



If you’re creating zero-to-one applications, giving the model  GPT-5 by default tries to be thorough and comprehensive

                                                               prescriptive about how eager it should be, and whether it

                                          should parallelize discovery/tool calling.

   - First, spend time thinking of a rubric 
                  Give the model a tool budget, specify when to be more or
                                                               less thorough, and when to check in with the user. For
      until you are confident.
                                example:

   - Then, think deeply about every aspect of  

                                                                  <persistence>

      that has 5-7 categories. This rubric is

      critical to get right, but do not show 
                       assumptions, as you can always adjust 

      this to the user. This is for your

      purposes only.
                                             — decide what the most reasonable assumption
